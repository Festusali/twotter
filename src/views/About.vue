    <p>
      <strong>Twooter</strong> is a just a practice project embarked on as I am learning Vue.js 3. There was no attempt in any way to make it a production ready Vue App.

      This app was inspired by twitter but it does not in anyway promise to offer Twitter features. However, some attempts was made to try implementing some fragments of Twitter features just for learning and practice purposes.
