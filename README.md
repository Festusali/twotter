# Twotter â€”Simple Twitter Clone

Twotter is a minimalistic Web Application built using VueJs version 3 by Ali Festus (festusali@gmail.com
https://github.com/Festusali/twotter.git)


## About Twooter
This app is a product of Vue Tutorial I took as a process of learning Vuejs. The design concept is inspired by [Twitter](https://twitter.com/). The features are not in anyway compared to that of Twitter but some actions and features are modelled to be a minimal version of that of Twitter.

The app is far from having complete set of features. In fact, no attempt has been made to provide extra features than is already provided. The design and dark theme was inspired by Vue UI dark theme.
